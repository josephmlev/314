# Discrete Uniform Distribution

## Introduction

Much of this class is about notation.  The next section attempts to
build on your experience about dice in an effort to minimize the
mental hurdles that follow this new notation.  Expanding on the
process of rolling a single die, we introduce a more formal definition
of a random variable.  Despite it's name, random variables are 1) not
random and 2) not variables.  They get this name nonetheless because
we think of them as variables that take on random values.

Using a fair die as an example of a random variable, we introduce a
particular, but not the only, notion of probability.  While it's easy
to get lost in the new notation and naturalness of this interpretation
of probability, don't lose site of the world's most interesting
processes.  Random variables are not always repeatable in an
*operational* manner, and thus it's not always obvious how probability
is meant to be understood in tese contexts.
