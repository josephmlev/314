# MATH 314 Lecture Notes

These MATH 314 lecture notes supplement the material presented in
class and the material found on the [course website](https://roualdes.us/teaching).

Pages might have [Binder](https://mybinder.org) links automatically
added for interactivity.

I'm trying something new (at least to me) here.  Instead of starting
with a slew of topics that don't show up, and thus make sense, until
much later in the course, I practicing in the art of just-in-time
teaching.  To be honest, I don't know if just-in-time teaching is a
thing.  These lecture notes are an experiment to find out.

## Getting started

To do well in this course, without becoming too stressed out, one
should know some calculus, namely derivatives and integration, and at
least have had an introduction to computer programming.  The course
will heavily use [R](https://cran.r-project.org/), but
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) is the suggested interface to the
language R.
