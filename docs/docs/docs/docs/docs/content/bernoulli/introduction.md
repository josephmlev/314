# Introduction

The Bernoulli distribution is our first attempt to connect data to
mathematical statistics.  We will learn that mathematical statistics
has a deep theory about what exactly produces data.  As with much of
mathematics, statistics theorizes that functions are the culprits
behind data.

To better understand these functions, we introduce early in this
course the fact that probability density functions are the theoretical
construct behind data and at the same time lead to the sample mean.
