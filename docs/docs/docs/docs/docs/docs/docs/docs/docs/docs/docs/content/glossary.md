# Glossary



* **population**
* **sample**
* **categorical variable**
    - a variable in a dataset that takes on not-mathable values
* **levels**
    - values that a categorical variable could take on
* **individual/observation**
    - a noun in the population of interest, not necessarily people
* **random variable**
    - a function from an event to a numerical value, e.g. $X(\\{Caniformia\\}) = 1$.
* **discrete random variable**
    - a random variable that only takes on a countable set of values
* **dataframe**
    - a two dimensional data structure in the programming language R
      in which each row represents a new observation and each column
      represents a new variable
* **Bernoullid distribution**
    - a named random variable used to binary outcomes; $1$ usually
      denotes level of interest

* **probability density function**
    - a function indexed by parameter(s) of interest, the shape of
      which theoretically describes the process of interest

* **statistic**
    - any function of data

* **proportion**
    - AKA a mean, when applied to numerically encoded binary
      categorical data; unfortunately thought of as $successes /
      trials$.

* **parameter**
    - a characteristic of a population, abstracted to
      non-dataarguments of probability density functions.

* **independent and identically distributed**
    - a description of data that suggests the data were randomly
      sampled (independent $\Rightarrow$ no two data points
      intentionally share anything in common, except) that they come
      from the same population (identically distributed).
