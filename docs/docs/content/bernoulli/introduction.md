# Bernoulli Data

 Description of binary *categorical* variables, which are numerically
 encoded (0/1) data.  Where does data come from?  Plot of *population*
 and *sample* depicted by circles, with arrows going from some of the
 individuals in the population to all of the elements in the sample.

 Will need paragraphs about:

 * population
 * sample
 * random variables
 * what statistics is trying to do
 * likelihood as how we try to do it
 * bootstrap to quantify our uncertainty in the small world setting
